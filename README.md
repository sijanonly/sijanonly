### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Neural Architecture Search using RL and understanding feature representation of deep learning models.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research/projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to understand 'What Machine Learning can achieve? without human aid?'. 
Formulating any ML problem is a hard job. Can we allow the computer itself to figure out 'how to formulate the problem?' . It sounds silly. But, if you look closely, data scientists/ ML engineers have to spend hours to formulate any machine learning problem into mathematical notion (which we called Objective Functions). And, computer does rest of the work -> finding the optimal parameters to fit the data or discover the pattern. What if computer itself formulate the notion of problem in machine understandable objective or goal?
