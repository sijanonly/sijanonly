### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Neural Architecture Search using RL and understanding feature representation of deep learning models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia for fun and reading Introduction to Pyychology by Atkinson & Hilgard's.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research/projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to understand 'What Machine Learning can achieve? without human aid?'. 
Formulating any ML problem is a hard job. Can we allow the computer itself to figure out 'how to formulate the problem?' . It sounds silly. But, if you look closely, data scientists/ ML engineers have to spend hours to formulate any machine learning problem into mathematical notion (which we called Objective Functions). And, computer does rest of the work -> finding the optimal parameters to fit the data or discover the pattern. What if computer itself formulate the notion of problem in machine understandable objective or goal?
