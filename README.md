### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒŸ I am actively looking for an opportunity to solve real-world problems with data science.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Neural Architecture Search using RL and understanding feature representation of deep learning models.
- ðŸ¤” Something that puzzles me - 'What Machine Learning can achieve? Without human aid?'.
Formulating any ML problem is a hard job. Can we allow the computer itself to figure out 'how to formulate the problem?' . It sounds silly. But, if you look closely, data scientists/ ML engineers have to spend hours to formulate any machine learning problem into mathematical notion (which we called Objective Functions). And, the computer does the rest of the work â†’ finding the optimal parameters to fit the data or discover the pattern. What if computer itself formulate the notion of problem in machine understandable objective or goal?
- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy discussing challenges of machine learning application development.
